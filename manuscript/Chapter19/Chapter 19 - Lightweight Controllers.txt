19 Lightweight Controllers
19.1 Why leightweight controllers
	- clean code & expressiveness
	- maintainability, easy to navigate logical steps
	- testing
	- reinforce the natural responsibility of the controller, which is to direct the storyboard page flow of an application
19.2 Decorating action results
	- key here is to encourage aggressive extension
	- this technique is for testing, is more suitable than a filter attribute, and works across action results
19.3 Apply filters in controller factory instead of a layer supertype
	- IOC tool in this example
	- again, aggressive extension of action invoker
19.4 Leveraging an application bus for a simple hub and spoke architecture
	- worried about this example.  not worried about actually producing the example, but having it muddle book altogether.
