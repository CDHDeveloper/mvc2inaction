how a csv is generated:

- domain objects are retrieved
- view model is mapped
- view model is array of ICsvLines
- lines are sent to csvresult
- csvresult service locates the appropriate ICsvReport<TModel>
- the CsvReport derives from CsvReportBase<TModel>
- CsvReportBase<TModel> is template method, has three virtual noop methods: Header, Sections, Footer
- since they go in order, inheritors can thereby order the output
- inheritor overrides a method and renders to a stringbuilder
- in one case, the inheritor news up a "ReportSectionBase" public abstract class ReportSectionBase<TModel> where TModel : IEnumerable<ICsvLine>
- the reportsectionbase defines the header fields and then iterates over its model, writing each line to the stringbuilder
